# lmake_version_from_date  
In cargo.toml writes the version as the date yy.mm.dd ex. 19.12.31.  
For non-library projects, the semver specification is not really useful.  
Having the version as the date is just fine for executables and much ore human readable.  
The exe must be executed in the root project folder where is the cargo.toml.  
No arguments needed to execute the exe.
